# 119
HW
This is my personal repository for my CSCI 119 course at Fresno State, Fall 2017. I use this repo to keep my work up-to-date between my PC and my laptop. All of these files are the original work of Mark Philipp.

All labs were done in Haskell. The course focuses on Finite State Machines, the theory behind them, and how to construct them.

Dislaimer: All the files in this repository are the original work of Mark Philipp. **These files are not available for copy or reproduction.** If you are taking Dr. Wilson's 119 course at Fresno State and you copy my files for your own use, I will not be held responsible for any academic punishment levied against you for copying.
